# Traffic-Signs-Recognition
Every driver must obey all traffic signs and restrictions in order to avoid an accident. To observe the guideline, one must first comprehend the appearance of the traffic sign. Before receiving a driver's license, a person must first study all of the traffic signs. However, driverless cars are becoming more common, and there will be no human drivers in the near future. In the Traffic Signs Recognition project, we create a software that uses a picture as input to recognize the type of traffic sign. We also created a basic graphical user interface (GUI) to communicate with the program.
